This repository contains code I wrote while reading the `Writing An Interpreter In Go` book by Thorsten Ball. 
The goal while reding this book was to learn abut how interpreters work and satisfy my curisity.

## Cool to try
* [ ] Command buffor in relp for arrows up and down for navigationg previous commands
* [ ] Support for runes
* [ ] Support for parsing floating point values
* [ ] Add non colliding hash
* [ ] Add support to passing files as input to the main.go
